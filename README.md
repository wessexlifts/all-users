# Scripts for All Users

Some script for Wessex users.

- `printer.ahk`: Runs in the background, and is meant to navigate the print
menu for the main office printer automatically. Input your printer number in
the `print_number.txt` file to do this.
- `stamp.ahk`: Runs on `Alt+F6`. Inserts a timestamp and signature (in
`initials.txt`).
- `lotus-smartcenter-close.ahk`: Meant to run on startup and simply closes the
Lotus SmartCenter bar when it loads up, then the script exits.

## Installation / Help

Please contact me for any information needed to run these.
