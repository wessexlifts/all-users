# Scripts for All Users

Some script for Wessex users. 

- `printer.ahk`: Runs in the background, and is meant to navigate the print
menu for the main office printer automatically. Input your printer number in
the `print_number.txt` file to do this.
- `stamp.ahk`: Runs on `Alt+F6`. Inserts a timestamp and signature (in
`initials.txt`).

## Installation / Help

Please contact me for any information needed to run these.
